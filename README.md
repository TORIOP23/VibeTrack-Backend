# VibeTrack-Backend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Download and install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Download dataset from [Driver](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m7HMmPJ-8e2SHFszBT5MFxa_whQqgwrE?usp=sharing)
  and
  place it in the `init-script` folder.
- (You must download the dataset yourself, as I cannot provide it due to GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB)

### Start the server

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Stop server

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Dataset
